### Motivation

The aim of this project is to analyse the given real estate dataset and provide a scoring criteria to measure an agents performance. In this analysis, I have tried to wrangle the dataset provided from the CRM platform and have used this dataset to come up with a agent performance scoring criteria and use this algorithm to choose the Top 3 agents in the brokerage firm.

I have also included suggestions for the brokerage firms to improve their agent's performances.


# Background

A Real estate agent works under a licensed broker (or brokerage). The brokerage provides the real estate agent with leads (leads are people who are looking to buy, sell or rent), and the agent's job is to help them in their home buying, selling or renting process. They do this by regularly following-up with them using calls, text messages or emails. After every follow-up with a lead, the activity is recorded on the CRM(CRM is a Customer Relationship Manager, which is a tool that agents use to log data for a particular lead).
